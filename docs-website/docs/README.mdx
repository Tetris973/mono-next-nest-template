## About The Project

This is a monorepo template that combines a NestJS backend (using Prisma and postgres) and a Next.js frontend, set up for Docker deployment. It's built as a complete, ready-to-use foundation for personal projects.

- It includes features like unit/E2E testing, CI, logging, authentication, and more (see full list in [root project README][root-project]).

Key points about this template:

1. **Strict Structure**: The project has a fixed way of organizing files, writing tests, and developing features. This removes the need to make many small decisions and keeps the code consistent.

2. **One Way to Do Things**: For most parts of the project, there's only one "right" way to add features. This makes it easy to jump back into the project, even after not working on it for a while.

3. **Full Working Example**: While it's not meant to be easily changed, this template shows how different parts of a full-stack app can work together. It's a reference for how to set up and connect various technologies.

4. **Learning Tool**: Even if you prefer to do things differently, this template can teach you about project setup, testing, and how to make different technologies work together.

5. **Personal Project Starter**: I made this mainly for my own use. It includes my preferred ways of doing things, so I can start new projects quickly without repeating the same setup steps.

This template isn't designed to be flexible or easy to customize. Instead, it's a complete, working example of a full-stack app using specific technologies and practices. It's best for developers who like this set way of doing things, or for those who want to see how different parts of a complex app can fit together.z

About my motivation to do this project:
</summary>

- For the questions "But who is your target audience?" and "Why did you do it?"
- My answer would be the same as a certain chemistry teacher's: "I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And... I was really... I was alive."

**LLM Beautified Version:**  
I'm still working on this project. While it's mostly for my personal use, I welcome feedback and contributions that fit with its main ideas.

**Original Text:**  
This project is not dead yet. Roast me so I can improve, thanks.

# Reducing Nested Blocks

Deeply nested code blocks can be hard to read and understand. We encourage writing code that minimizes nesting.

## Guidelines

1. Use early returns to handle edge cases or errors.
2. Consider extracting nested logic into separate functions.
3. Use functional programming techniques like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` instead of nested loops when appropriate.

# React Component Testing

When testing React components, it's generally best to use locators that reflect what a user would see or interact with. This approach makes your tests more robust and less likely to break due to implementation changes. Here's an order of preference for locators, from most preferred to least:

1. **Accessible names** (using `getByRole` with `name` option)
   - These are the most user-centric and robust.
   - They work well with screen readers and represent how users interact with your app.

2. **Text content** (`getByText`)
   - This is what users see on the screen, making it a good choice for buttons, labels, and other visible text.

3. **Form labels** (`getByLabelText`)
   - These are specifically useful for form inputs and represent how users identify form fields.

4. **Placeholders** (`getByPlaceholderText`)
   - While not as robust as labels (they disappear when the user types), they can be useful for some input fields.

5. **Semantic HTML** (`getByRole` without `name` option)
   - This uses the implicit roles of HTML elements, which can be good for general structure but may be less specific than other options.

6. **Test IDs** (`getByTestId`)
   - While useful as a last resort, they're not visible to users and can make tests more brittle if not managed carefully.

This approach ensures that your tests interact with components in a way that's similar to how users would, making your tests more meaningful and reliable.

:::tip
When writing tests, try to use the highest priority locator that makes sense for each situation. This will make your tests more robust and representative of actual user interactions.
:::

:::caution
Avoid using implementation details like class names or tag names for selecting elements in your tests. These can change without affecting the user experience and may make your tests brittle.

By following these guidelines, you'll create tests that are not only more stable and less prone to breaking with UI changes, but also tests that better represent how users actually interact with your application.

# Purpose of Tests

Tests serve multiple purposes in the development process:

1. **Documentation**: Tests act as documentation, showcasing what the source code is expected to accomplish, its behavior, expected data, and security measures (like error throwing).

2. **Regression Prevention**: Tests help prevent regressions by catching unintended changes in functionality.

3. **Code Quality**: Writing testable code often leads to better design and more modular code.

4. **Confidence**: Tests provide confidence when refactoring or adding new features.

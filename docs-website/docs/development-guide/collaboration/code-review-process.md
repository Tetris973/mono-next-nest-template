# Code Review Process

> **Disclaimer**: The following documentation was entirely generated by an LLM and has not been verified at this time. I do not yet have extensive experience in this area. This document serves as a draft guideline for areas where I should gain knowledge to establish an effective code review process.

TODO: Gain experience with code reviews and make a checklist. This checklist should serve as a guide for both reviewers and developers, covering key points to verify during a review. Not every item will apply to every review, but trying to follow it as much as possible is a good start.

> **Info**: Code reviews are a crucial part of maintaining code quality, sharing knowledge, and fostering collaboration within a development team. A well-structured code review process can significantly improve overall project health.

1. **Purpose of Code Reviews**:
   - Ensure code quality and consistency
   - Share knowledge and best practices
   - Catch bugs and security issues early
   - Promote collective code ownership

2. **Review Checklist**:
   - Code adheres to project style guide
   - Functionality meets requirements
   - No unnecessary complexity or premature optimization
   - Proper error handling and edge case consideration
   - Adequate test coverage
   - Documentation is clear and up-to-date

3. **Reviewer Responsibilities**:
   - Respond to review requests promptly (within 24-48 hours)
   - Provide constructive, actionable feedback
   - Consider both the code and its larger impact on the project
   - Approve changes only when confident in their quality

4. **Author Responsibilities**:
   - Create focused, manageable pull requests
   - Provide context and explanation in the PR description
   - Be responsive to feedback and questions
   - Make requested changes promptly

5. **Review Process**:
   - Author creates a pull request and assigns reviewers
   - Reviewers examine the code and provide comments
   - Author addresses feedback and makes necessary changes
   - Reviewers re-examine and approve or request further changes
   - Once approved, author merges the changes

6. **Best Practices for Reviewers**:
   - Be respectful and constructive in comments
   - Explain the "why" behind suggested changes
   - Provide examples or references when applicable
   - Acknowledge good code and creative solutions

7. **Best Practices for Authors**:
   - Respond to all comments, even if just to acknowledge
   - Explain the reasoning behind contested changes
   - Be open to feedback and alternative approaches
   - Update the PR description with significant changes made during review

8. **Automated Checks**:
   - Integrate automated checks (linting, tests, etc.) into the PR process
   - Address failing checks before requesting review

9. **Post-Review**:
   - Conduct periodic reviews of the review process itself
   - Share learnings and common issues with the wider team
   - Use insights from reviews to update coding standards and practices

10. **Review Culture**:
    - Emphasize that reviews are about the code, not the person
    - Encourage knowledge sharing and mentorship through reviews
    - Recognize and appreciate thorough, helpful reviews

Remember, the goal of code reviews is to improve overall code quality and team collaboration. It's not about finding fault, but about learning, sharing knowledge, and collectively producing the best possible code. Adapt these guidelines to fit your team's specific needs and project requirements.

# Simplicity First

Prioritize simplicity in code and architecture. This principle helps maintain a codebase that is easy to understand, modify, and debug.

### Guidelines:

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: 
   - Prioritize clear, straightforward code over overly clever or complex solutions.
   - If a clever solution is necessary, document why it is necessary thoroughly.

2. **Keep It Simple (KISS)**:
   - Favor simpler solutions over complex ones when possible.
   - Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.

Remember, code is read far more often than it is written. Investing time in readability pays off in easier maintenance, fewer bugs, and smoother onboarding for new team members.

# Avoiding Premature Abstraction

While abstraction can lead to more flexible and maintainable code, premature abstraction can often lead to unnecessary complexity.

### Guidelines:

1. **Start Concrete**: Begin with concrete implementations. For example, when writing socket endpoints, implement the first one without worrying about abstraction for authentication or error handling.

2. **Rule of Three**: Consider creating an abstraction only when you encounter very similar code for the third or more times. This helps avoid creating abstractions that aren't actually needed.

3. **Refactor to Abstraction**: Instead of trying to design the perfect abstraction upfront, start with specific implementations and refactor to abstractions as patterns emerge.

Remember, these principles are guidelines, not strict rules. Use your judgment to apply them appropriately in different situations. The goal is to create maintainable, efficient, and adaptable code that serves the needs of our project and team.

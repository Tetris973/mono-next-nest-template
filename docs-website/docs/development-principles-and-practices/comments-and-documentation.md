# Comments and Documentation

Proper use of comments and documentation is essential for maintaining a clear and understandable codebase.

### Guidelines:

1. **Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that is self-explanatory where possible. Use clear variable and function names that describe their purpose.

2. **Explain the "Why"**: Use comments to explain "why" rather than "what" when the code isn't self-explanatory. The "what" should be clear from the code itself.

3. **Complex Logic**: For very complex logic (e.g., bit shift for the fast inverse square root in the doom game engine), detailed comments explaining the "what" may be necessary.

4. **Keep Comments Updated**: Treat comments as part of the code. Keep them up-to-date as the code changes. Well-written comments should evolve with the code and be considered equally important.

5. **Documentation for Public APIs**: Provide thorough documentation for public APIs, including function signatures, parameter descriptions, return values, and usage examples.

Remember, good comments and documentation serve as a guide for future developers (including yourself) who may need to understand or modify the code.

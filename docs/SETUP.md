# Detailed Setup Guide

This guide provides examples of how to set up a development environment for this project. Feel free to use alternative tools that accomplish the same tasks if you prefer.

## Essential Tools

### Package Manager

For macOS, Homebrew is one option for a package manager. Here's how you might install it:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

For more information and installation options, visit the [official Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).

For Windows or Linux, you can use any package manager you're comfortable with.

### Version Control System

Git is used in this project for version control. If you're using macOS with Homebrew, you could install it like this:

```sh
brew install git
```

For other operating systems, refer to the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Node.js Version Management

One way to manage Node.js versions is with nvm. Here's an example of how to set it up on macOS:

```sh
brew install nvm
mkdir ~/.nvm
```

You might add the following to your shell profile (e.g., ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile):

```sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"
```

Then, source your profile:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Node.js

This project uses Node.js version 20.x. Here's how you might install it using nvm:

```sh
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

### Package Manager for Node.js

This project uses pnpm. You can install it globally like this:

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Environment Variable Management

dotenv-cli is used in this project. You can install it globally like this:

```sh
pnpm add -g dotenv-cli
```

## Containerization

Docker is used for containerization in this project. You can download Docker Desktop from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## IDE and Extensions

Visual Studio Code is used in this project. You can download it from the [official VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The following VS Code extensions are used:
- ESLint: JavaScript linter
- JSON Comments (publisher: wxzhang): For viewing comments in JSON files

You can install these from the Extensions view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X).

Note on JSON Comments extension: This is an extension that I've found useful for adding documentation to package.json files. While it may not be the ideal solution (other JSON files like TypeScript configs accept comments natively), it's currently the best option I've found for keeping documentation close to the code. 

In my opinion, it's valuable to document package uses and npm script command options, not necessarily describing what the command does (unless it's not explicit from the code), but explaining why certain configurations were chosen. This can be particularly helpful when there are constraints from dependencies that require specific parameters to prevent code breakage.

However, this is just my preference and approach. You're free to use different methods for documentation or even skip this extension if it doesn't align with your workflow.

## Version Control Platform Setup

This project uses GitLab. Here's how you might set it up:

1. Create a GitLab account if you don't have one
2. Generate an SSH key:
   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
3. Add the SSH key to your GitLab account:
   - Copy the public key:
     ```sh
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - In GitLab, go to Settings > SSH Keys, paste your key, and save

## Verifying Your Setup

You can check if the tools are correctly installed by running these commands:

```sh
git --version
brew --version
nvm --version
node --version
pnpm --version
docker --version
code --version
```

If any command is not recognized, you may need to revisit the installation steps for that tool.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup:

1. Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements for all the tools.
2. Check that you have the necessary permissions to install software on your system.
3. If you're behind a firewall or proxy, ensure you have the necessary network access.
4. For persistent issues, consult the official documentation of the respective tools or reach out to Google, Reddit, Stack Overflow, or an LLM for assistance.
